## Usage:

```
cargo run --release --bin processor_1 -- --game-dir <game dir> --output-dir .
```
A dumb processor that just groups tracks based on prefix.

```
cargo run --release --bin playa -- <sbf file>
```
A program that can be used to reorder parts of a track so that they fit together better. It will save its config to `reordering_config.json`

```
cargo run --release --bin processor_2 -- --game-dir <game dir> --output-dir .
```
It uses `reordering_config.json` generated by previous program to generate output files.
